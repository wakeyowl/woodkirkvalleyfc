                Welcome to the Woodkirk Valley <strong> Parent and Player </strong> Registration site

                As of the 25th May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) comes into force across the
                European Union  and brings with it the most significant changes to data protection law in two decades.
                Based on privacy by design and taking a risk-based approach, the GDPR has been designed to meet the
                requirements of the digital age.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The 21st Century brings with it broader use of technology, new definitions of what constitutes personal
                data, and a vast increase in cross-border processing. The new Regulation aims to standardise data
                protection laws and processing across the EU; affording individuals stronger, more consistent rights to
                access and control their personal information. As such please make yourself familiar with the club's
                privacy policy (see above menu and can also be located on the club's website)
